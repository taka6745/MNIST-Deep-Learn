# MNIST Handwriting Recognition with Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies deep learning techniques to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It focuses on utilizing advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Custom script for loading and preprocessing MNIST data.
- **Advanced CNN Architecture**: Enhanced CNN model with batch normalization and dropout for improved accuracy.
- **Training Script**: Comprehensive training script with early stopping and learning rate reduction.
- **Evaluation Script**: Detailed evaluation of the model performance on test data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib (for evaluation and visualization)

## Usage
1. **Preprocessing**: Run `preprocessing.py` to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. **Training**: Execute `train.py` to train the model. Adjust epochs, batch size, and callbacks as needed.
3. **Evaluation**: Use `evaluate.py` to assess the model's performance on the test set.

## Repository Structure
- `/preprocessing.py`: Script for data loading and preprocessing.
- `/model.py`: Defines the CNN model architecture.
- `/train.py`: Script for training the model.
- `/evaluate.py`: Evaluates the trained model on test data.

## Running the Project
Ensure all dependencies are installed, and run the scripts in the order of preprocessing, training, and evaluation. The model's weights can be saved and loaded for further analysis or deployment.

## Note
This project is educational and serves as a practical approach to understanding deep learning applied to image classification tasks.
